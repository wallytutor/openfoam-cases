# Setup with thermophysical properties

Base case for setting up `rhoSimpleFoam` with different thermophysical properties.

## Available thermophysical files

For water:

- [File 1:](constant/water/thermophysicalProperties-1) using a predefined material (H2O) for the mixture.
- [File 2:](constant/water/thermophysicalProperties-2) mixture setup with all properties held constant.
- [File 3:](constant/water/thermophysicalProperties-3) mixture setup with all polynomial properties as provided [here](https://holzmann-cfd.com/community/blog-and-tools/cae-blog/thermophysical-properties-water).

For air:

- [File 1:](constant/water/thermophysicalProperties-1) mixture setup with all properties held constant.
- [File 2:](constant/water/thermophysicalProperties-2) mixture setup with all polynomial properties.
